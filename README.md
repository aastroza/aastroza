### Recent Activities

- **[August 2024]** üç≤ [Carbonada](https://carbonada.cl/) is an AI-powered educational game that helps users, especially children, learn about their carbon footprint in a fun, interactive way. Using GPT-4 for carbon estimation, the game simulates creating a dish where each ingredient adds to the total footprint. If the carbon limit is exceeded, the dish "explodes," teaching users the impact of their choices. The [project](https://github.com/aastroza/carbonada) also offers a public API for calculating carbon footprints, making it a versatile tool for both education and analysis.
- **[June 2024]**
  - üèÜ [**Beated GPT-4 with Open Source**](https://blog.dottxt.co/oss-v-gpt4.html). Thanks to the work I began with [my benchmark](https://alonsoastroza.com/posts/structured-generation-benchmark/) and the subsequent collaboration with the [Outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) community, we successfully outperformed the best-performing GPT-4 model at a task that OpenAI essentially invented: *function calling*.
  - üòÇ Released [Datarisas](https://github.com/aastroza/chilean-humor), a database to track the history of chilean humor.
- **[May 2024]** üí¨ Released [Chatstract](https://github.com/aastroza/chatstract), a tool for progressively extracts structured information from multi-turn user chats using pydantic schemas and LLMs. Powered by [OpenAI API](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) + [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/).
- **[April 2024]**
  - üìö Released the [Repository Template for Course Websites](https://github.com/aastroza/course-template), a tool for educators to easily create and manage course sites using GitHub Pages, powered by GitHub Actions and Material for MkDocs. I realized I was repeating this process every time I created a course, so why not automate it a bit?
  - üöÄ Launched a [GitHub project](https://github.com/aastroza/rss-feeds-scraper) to scrape RSS feeds into daily json files, driven by the need for a quick dataset to grasp "what's happening in the country." Automated with GitHub Actions, it runs every 24 hours. This is part of a larger project‚Äîstay tuned.
- **[February 2024]** üí° I'm currently working with [Subconscious.ai](https://www.subconscious.ai/) to help build an AI Copilot for Causal Market Research. It's my first time working with Langchain's [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/), and I've managed to shift the whole query process for LLMs into this new framework. 
- **[January 2024]** üåå I recently taught an intensive data science workshop titled ["Orbiting Jupiter and Landing on Earth: A Journey in GitHub Towards Practical and Collaborative Data Science"](https://idsudd.github.io/github-workshop/). This course focused on transforming the way students approach data science, shifting from solitary projects in Jupyter Notebook to a more collaborative and practical approach, ready for integration into real software environments.
- **[December 2023]** üìñ Co-created the AI engine for the "[Explorador Constitucional](https://www.latercera.com/la-tercera-sabado/noticia/cuales-son-las-diferencias-entre-los-textos-constitucionales/RUC2LB45ZBAEHN3RFKDEGI6ZRE/)" a joint project by [La Tercera](https://www.latercera.com/) (one of Chile's largest newspapers) and [CRiSSLab](https://criss-lab.com/). Deployed an OpenAI API-based product in production, which efficiently searches, summarizes, and compares constitutional texts. The site attracted over 5,000 users per day. The first version of the code is [here](https://github.com/aastroza/llm-search-discolab).
