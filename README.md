### Recent Activities

- **[May 2024]** 💬 Released [Chatstract](https://github.com/aastroza/chatstract), a tool for progressively extracts structured information from multi-turn user chats using pydantic schemas and LLMs. Powered by [OpenAI API](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) + [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/).
- **[April 2024]**
  - 📚 Released the [Repository Template for Course Websites](https://github.com/aastroza/course-template), a tool for educators to easily create and manage course sites using GitHub Pages, powered by GitHub Actions and Material for MkDocs. I realized I was repeating this process every time I created a course, so why not automate it a bit?
  - 🚀 Launched a [GitHub project](https://github.com/aastroza/rss-feeds-scraper) to scrape RSS feeds into daily json files, driven by the need for a quick dataset to grasp "what's happening in the country." Automated with GitHub Actions, it runs every 24 hours. This is part of a larger project—stay tuned.
- **[February 2024]** 💡 I'm currently working with [Subconscious.ai](https://www.subconscious.ai/) to help build an AI Copilot for Causal Market Research. It's my first time working with Langchain's [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/), and I've managed to shift the whole query process for LLMs into this new framework. 
- **[January 2024]** 🌌 I recently taught an intensive data science workshop titled ["Orbiting Jupiter and Landing on Earth: A Journey in GitHub Towards Practical and Collaborative Data Science"](https://idsudd.github.io/github-workshop/). This course focused on transforming the way students approach data science, shifting from solitary projects in Jupyter Notebook to a more collaborative and practical approach, ready for integration into real software environments.
- **[December 2023]** 📖 Co-created the AI engine for the "[Explorador Constitucional](https://www.latercera.com/la-tercera-sabado/noticia/cuales-son-las-diferencias-entre-los-textos-constitucionales/RUC2LB45ZBAEHN3RFKDEGI6ZRE/)" a joint project by [La Tercera](https://www.latercera.com/) (one of Chile's largest newspapers) and [CRiSSLab](https://criss-lab.com/). Deployed an OpenAI API-based product in production, which efficiently searches, summarizes, and compares constitutional texts. The site attracted over 5,000 users per day. The first version of the code is [here](https://github.com/aastroza/llm-search-discolab).
